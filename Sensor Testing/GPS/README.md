# GPS Testing

This directory contains arduino test code for the Adafruit Ultimate GPS.

Sensors are tested either using **Python** or **C** on the **Raspberry Pi** or using **Arduino C** on an **Arduino**.

Raw_gps_code – prints everything to the serial monitor. This is useful in case you want to see functions to get latitude, longitude, altitude, etc

Raw_gps_code_onlyspeed – only prints speed, number of satellites, and dt to the serial monitor
